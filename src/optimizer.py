""" 
This file contains the logic for optimizing the circuit. The main focus is on making the circuit more efficient, which could involve reducing power consumption, 
improving speed, or simplifying the design.

Tasks:

Optimize Circuit: Perform calculations or use algorithms to reduce the complexity, size, or power consumption of the circuit.
Return Optimized Circuit: Return a modified version of the circuit that has been optimized.
Example tasks:

Replace certain components with more efficient ones.
Re-route connections to reduce resistance or improve performance.
Use algorithms like greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms for optimization.

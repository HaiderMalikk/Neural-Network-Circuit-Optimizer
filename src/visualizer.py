This file is responsible for visualizing the circuit and its optimization process. It could generate graphs or visual representations of the circuit's layout, components, and connections.

Tasks:

Visualize Circuit: Create visual representations (e.g., graphs or diagrams) to help understand the circuit's layout and connections.
Visualize Optimization: Show before-and-after views of the circuit to demonstrate how optimization has improved it.

""" 
Circuit class, which represents the entire circuit that im working with in my project. The Circuit class is where i would store all the components and their connections, 
essentially managing the whole structure of the circuit.

The Purpose of the Circuit Class:
The Circuit class acts as a container for all the components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) and their connections.
You can add, remove, and manage components within the circuit, and it allows you to store information like component values, types, and their relationships 
(e.g., which component is connected to which).

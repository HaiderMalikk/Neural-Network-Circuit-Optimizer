""" 
This file is responsible for simulating the behavior of the circuit. The simulation could focus on power consumption, signal strength, or other performance metrics.

Tasks:

Simulate Circuit: Simulate how the circuit will behave based on the components and connections (e.g., calculate the power consumption, current flow, or voltage).
Return Simulation Results: Output the results of the simulation, such as power usage or any other relevant metric.
